# Blue Fenix privacy policy

*Last updated: April 4, 2020*

The privacy of your data is important to us. We’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug. We’ll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. 

## Law enforcement

Blue Fenix Productions won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Security & Encryption

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Data isn’t encrypted while it's live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it).

## Location of Site and Data

This Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.


## Changes & questions

Blue Fenix Productions may update this policy once in a while — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing you or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting [our support team][support].

Questions about this privacy policy? Please [contact us][support] and we’ll be happy to answer them!
